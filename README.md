![image](image.jpg)


## Overview

Promethium Data Connector Utility is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify data integration and performance optimization for Trino/Presto databases. The utility streamlines the process of connecting to various data sources, optimizing query execution, and providing insightful performance metrics. It ensures that your data-driven workflows are efficient and scalable, catering to the needs of todayâ€™s dynamic data environments.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration:** Seamlessly connect to multiple data sources using our extended Trino connectors.
- **Query Optimization:** Automatically identify bottlenecks and optimize query execution plans for improved performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Run and analyze software performance metrics to maintain high efficiency.
- **Global Collaboration:** Fully compatible with Agile development environments and supports collaboration across multiple time zones.
- **Automation Support:** Write and run automated tests as part of the ongoing infrastructure development.
- **Scalability:** Guide DevOps and Data Engineering teams to scale Trino clusters to handle petabytes of data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
- **Apache Maven 3.6.3 or higher**
- **Docker** (for running containers)
- **Kubectl** (for interacting with Kubernetes clusters)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/promethium-data-connector.git
   cd promethium-data-connector
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Set up the required Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

## Usage

### Configuration

The application requires a configuration file (`config.yml`) to define the data sources and other parameters. An example configuration file is provided in the repository:

```yaml
trino:
  host: your-trino-host
  port: 8080
  user: your-username
  catalog: your-catalog
  schema: your-schema

sources:
  - name: source1
    type: mysql
    host: mysql-host
    port: 3306
    user: mysql-user
    password: mysql-password
    database: mysql-database

  - name: source2
    type: postgres
    host: postgres-host
    port: 5432
    user: postgres-user
    password: postgres-password
    database: postgres-database
```

### Running the Application

Start the application using the following command:

```bash
java -jar target/promethium-data-connector.jar --config config.yml
```

### Optimizing Queries

The utility provides a built-in optimizer. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Submit your SQL query to the optimizer endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -d @query.sql http://localhost:8080/optimize
   ```

2. Receive the optimized query and execution plan:

   ```json
   {
     "optimizedQuery": "SELECT * FROM optimized_table",
     "executionPlan": { ... }
   }
   ```

### Viewing Performance Metrics

The application exposes performance metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint. Access it via your web browser or a tool like `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Running Automated Tests

To ensure that your configurations and connectors work as expected, run the automated test suite:

```bash
mvn test
```
